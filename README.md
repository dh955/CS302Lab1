Summary: Daniel has worked on the file input and storing the inputs into the structs, whilst Ian worked on the the output and
formatting it to match the gradescripts. We worked together by communicating through imessage about any problems we had and
sending code over github whenever we were finished. We divided the project to make sure both sides got a fair amount of work 
and helped whenever a problem arised.
